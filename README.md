# Space Invader Game
This repository hosts the Space Invader Game, an educational “project” designed to teach key computer science concepts through game development using Squeak/Smalltalk. The project follows a “trojan horse” mindset, embedding core IT learning objectives such as object-oriented programming, event-driven mechanics and UI/UX design in an engaging and interactive game format.

The implementation is organized in a step-by-step structure with five parts, ranging from basic game environment and spaceship creation to more advanced features and customizations. Each part contains clear context, prerequisites, detailed workflow and challenges to encourage creative extensions and further understanding.

Additional and more thorough educational content and explanation, including release versions containing base and extended code are available via the Wiki and Releases sections.
